<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in a lively neighborhood, surrounded by childrenâ€™s laughter and dreams bigger than the walls of my home. From an early age, I learned that life was not always easy, but I also understood that every challenge could be turned into strength.</p>

<p>At school, I stood out for my curiosity and my determination to always do better. On the football field, I came alive: fast, smart, and passionate. The ball became my refuge, my language, my way of expressing myself.</p>

<p>As time passed, I grew, but my values never changed: discipline, respect, and the desire to succeed. In my work, I am rigorous, attentive to detail, and always ready to find solutions. In my personal life, I remain simple, humble, and loyal to those I care about.</p>

<p>Today, I continue to build my path, balancing ambition and simplicity, with one goal in mind: to keep moving forward, learning, and leaving a positive mark behind.</p>
